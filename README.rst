===========================================
Fledge WatchDog notification rule plugin
===========================================

A time based based notification rule plugin:

The configuration items  are:

  - "asset" is the asset name to check in plugin_eval call
  - "interval" is the time value for plugin_eval calls from
    notification service, specified in milliseconds

Note: this plugin is designed to work with a single asset name.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    {
	"asset": {
		"description": "The asset name to check.",
		"name": "sinusoid"
	},
	"interval": {
		"description": "The time interval for rule call",
		"name": "Time interval",
		"type": "integer",
		"value": 5000
	}
    }

If no data is received for the asset within the specified time period then
the rule evaluates to true.  

Build
-----
To build Fledge "WatchDog" notification rule C++ plugin,
in addition fo Fledge source code, the Notification server C++
header files are required (no .cpp files or libraries needed so far)

The path with Notification server C++ header files cab be specified only via
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_INCLUDE_DIRS environment variable.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

  $ export NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_INCLUDE_DIRS=/home/ubuntu/source/fledge-service-notification/C/services/common/include

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

- By default the Fledge develop package header files and libraries
  are expected to be located in /usr/include/fledge and /usr/lib/fledge
- If **FLEDGE_ROOT** env var is set and no -D options are set,
  the header files and libraries paths are pulled from the ones under the
  FLEDGE_ROOT directory.
  Please note that you must first run 'make' in the FLEDGE_ROOT directory.

You may also pass one or more of the following options to cmake to override 
this default behaviour:

- **FLEDGE_SRC** sets the path of a Fledge source tree
- **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** sets the path to Fledge header files
- **FLEDGE_LIB sets** the path to Fledge libraries
- **FLEDGE_INSTALL** sets the installation path of Random plugin

NOTE:
 - The **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** option should point to a location where all the Fledge 
   header files have been installed in a single directory.
 - The **FLEDGE_LIB** option should point to a location where all the Fledge
   libraries have been installed in a single directory.
 - 'make install' target is defined only when **FLEDGE_INSTALL** is set

Examples:

- no options

  $ cmake ..

- no options and FLEDGE_ROOT set

  $ export FLEDGE_ROOT=/some_fledge_setup

  $ cmake ..

- set FLEDGE_SRC

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_SRC=/home/source/develop/Fledge  ..

- set FLEDGE_INCLUDE

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INCLUDE=/dev-package/include ..
- set FLEDGE_LIB

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_LIB=/home/dev/package/lib ..
- set FLEDGE_INSTALL

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/home/source/develop/Fledge ..

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/usr/local/fledge ..
